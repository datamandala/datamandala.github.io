Some hundred years ago poeple used to fight territorial wars. Some 50 years ago people used to fight wars on ideology. Some 20 years ago people used to fight financial wars. Nowadays people fight data wars. 
It has never been easy to fight wars, just because the current war itself seems to be half step ahead of the mindset of the warriors. 

I am not a warrior.

I am a data messenger.
