Some hundred years ago people used to fight territorial wars. Some 50 years ago people used to fight wars on ideology. Some 20 years ago people used to fight financial wars. Nowadays people fight data wars. 
It has never been easy to fight the war-of-the-day, just because the current war itself seems to be half step ahead of the mindset of the warriors (you see, in general, people tend not to fight about issues which are smaller than them). 

I am not a warrior.

I am a data messenger.
