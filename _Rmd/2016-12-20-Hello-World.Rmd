I used to blog a lot. Mostly about SQL Server. 
This was some time ago when SQL Server performance and database development was key. 
Nowadays I work mostly with data and am trying to focus on data-driven results. 



Here is my old site [SQLConcept.com](http://SQLConcept.com).

And here is where I write for [Simple-talk](https://www.simple-talk.com/author/feodor-georgiev/) and [Redgate](https://www.red-gate.com/blog/author/feodor-georgiev).
